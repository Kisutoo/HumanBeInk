  titre1: "What is a Flash?"
  description_1: "A tattoo flash is a pre-designed tattoo motif, created by the tattoo artist, ready to be tattooed as is. These designs are often displayed in the shop or published on my social media, and they allow for quicker tattooing at a more affordable price than a custom tattoo. Please note that they are unique and can only be tattooed once per person."
